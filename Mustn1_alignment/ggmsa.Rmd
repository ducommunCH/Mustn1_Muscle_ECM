## Generate multiple sequence alignment

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load required libraries

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(ggmsa)
```

Read Mustn1 protein sequences from file

```{r sequence}
protein_sequences <- "Mustang.txt"
```

Run ggmsa and plot using color coding by amino acid property

```{r ggmsa}
ggmsa(protein_sequences, start = 1, end = 82, color = "Chemistry_AA",
      font = "helvetical", by_conservation = FALSE, 
      char_width = 0.5, seq_name = T, border = NA, consensus_views = FALSE, disagreement = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE)
```

The alignment and color-coding was used to remake the figure using Inkscape
